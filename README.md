# Employee Display

## Description

I made this employee display to improve on a previous employee display I made. I wanted this one to be more complex with many more features. This application is a great way to display and keep track of employees. You can update employee rolls, add employees and even add whole new departments. I learned a lot about structure of sql and relationships between data tables.

## Installation and Usage

The installation is pretty similar to most backend applications. First, type 'npm i' in the terminal to install all required packages. All you need to do from there is 'node server' in the terminal to start the program. From there, all you have to do is navigate through the prompts and to accomplish whichever task.

## Credits

I would like to heavily credit the DU bootcamp class work with tons of examples to work from.

## Tests

Try adding a new role and changing a current employee to the role!
